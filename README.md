## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Cons with Initial OBAL:**
- Uses **analog Rx protocol (PPM)**, limiting flexibility.
- Limited to **GY-91 IMU** (only possible IMU).
- **Safety switch** has electronic issues.
- No proper **logic conversion** (mix of **5V and 3.3V** with Raspberry Pi).
- Uses an **old Linux version**, requiring recompilation to disable **`CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM`**.
- **32-bit Ardupilot** applications limit performance.

---
## üí° **OBAL_V2 Improvements**  
**OBAL_V2** offers significant improvements, including :
- **64-bit architecture** for better performance.
- More **flexible Rx protocols** (IBUS, SBUS).
- Better **IMU support** (GY-91, GY-912, and more).
- **Automated setup** via script, simplifying the process.
